*Disclaimer*: This is not an official Google product.

tarpc is an RPC framework for rust with a focus on ease of use. Defining a
service can be done in just a few lines of code, and most of the boilerplate of
writing a server is taken care of for you.

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/tarpc)

## What is an RPC framework?
"RPC" stands for "Remote Procedure Call," a function call where the work of
producing the return value is being done somewhere else. When an rpc function is
invoked, behind the scenes the function contacts some other process somewhere
and asks them to evaluate the function instead. The original function then
returns the value produced by the other process.

RPC frameworks are a fundamental building block of most microservices-oriented
architectures. Two well-known ones are [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io) and
[Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/).

tarpc differentiates itself from other RPC frameworks by defining the schema in code,
rather than in a separate language such as .proto. This means there's no separate compilation
process, and no cognitive context switching between different languages. Additionally, it
works with the community-backed library serde: any serde-serializable type can be used as
arguments to tarpc fns.

## Usage
**NB**: *this example is for master. Are you looking for other
[versions](https://docs.rs/tarpc)?*

Add to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
tarpc = { git = "https://github.com/google/tarpc" }
tarpc-plugins = { git = "https://github.com/google/tarpc" }
```

## Example
```rust
// required by `FutureClient` (not used in this example)
#![feature(conservative_impl_trait, plugin)]
#![plugin(tarpc_plugins)]

extern crate futures;
#[macro_use]
extern crate tarpc;

use tarpc::util::Never;
use tarpc::sync::Connect;

service! {
    rpc hello(name: String) -> String;
}

#[derive(Clone)]
struct HelloServer;

impl SyncService for HelloServer {
    fn hello(&self, name: String) -> Result<String, Never> {
        Ok(format!("Hello, {}!", name))
    }
}

fn main() {
    let addr = "localhost:10000";
    let _server = HelloServer.listen(addr).unwrap();
    let client = SyncClient::connect(addr).unwrap();
    println!("{}", client.hello(&"Mom".to_string()).unwrap());
}
```

The `service!` macro expands to a collection of items that form an
rpc service. In the above example, the macro is called within the
`hello_service` module. This module will contain `SyncClient`, `AsyncClient`,
and `FutureClient` types, and `SyncService` and `AsyncService` traits.  There is
also a `ServiceExt` trait that provides starter `fn`s for services, with an
umbrella impl for all services.  These generated types make it easy and
ergonomic to write servers without dealing with sockets or serialization
directly. Simply implement one of the generated traits, and you're off to the
races! See the tarpc_examples package for more examples.

## Documentation
Use `cargo doc` as you normally would to see the documentation created for all
items expanded by a `service!` invocation.

## Additional Features
- Configurable server rate limiting.
- Automatic client retries with exponential backoff when server is busy.
- Concurrent requests from a single client.
- Backed by an mio `EventLoop`, protecting services (including `SyncService`s)
  from slowloris attacks.
- Run any number of clients on a single client event loop.
- Run any number of services on a single service event loop.
- Configure clients and services to run on a custom event loop, defaulting to
  the global event loop.
- Any type that `impl`s `serde`'s `Serialize` and `Deserialize` can be used in
  rpc signatures.
- Attributes can be specified on rpc methods. These will be included on both the
  services' trait methods as well as on the clients' stub methods.

## Gaps/Potential Improvements (not necessarily actively being worked on)
- Load balancing
- Service discovery
- Automatically reconnect on the client side when the connection cuts out.
- Support generic serialization protocols.
