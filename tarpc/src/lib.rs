//! tarpc is an RPC framework for rust with a focus on ease of use. Defining a
//! service can be done in just a few lines of code, and most of the boilerplate of
//! writing a server is taken care of for you.
//!
//! [Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/tarpc/)
//!
//! ## What is an RPC framework?
//! "RPC" stands for "Remote Procedure Call," a function call where the work of
//! producing the return value is being done somewhere else. When an rpc function is
//! invoked, behind the scenes the function contacts some other process somewhere
//! and asks them to evaluate the function instead. The original function then
//! returns the value produced by the other process.
//!
//! RPC frameworks are a fundamental building block of most microservices-oriented
//! architectures. Two well-known ones are [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io) and
//! [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/).
//!
//! tarpc differentiates itself from other RPC frameworks by defining the schema in code,
//! rather than in a separate language such as .proto. This means there's no separate compilation
//! process, and no context switching between different languages.
//!
//! Some other features of tarpc:
//! - Pluggable transport: any type implementing `Stream<Item = Request> + Sink<Response>` can be
//!   used as a transport to connect the client and server.
//! - `Send + 'static` optional: if the transport doesn't require it, neither does tarpc!
//! - Cascading cancellation: dropping a request will send a cancellation message to the server.
//!   The server will cease any unfinished work on the request, subsequently cancelling any of its
//!   own requests, repeating for the entire chain of transitive dependencies.
//! - Configurable deadlines and deadline propagation: request deadlines default to 10s if
//!   unspecified. The server will automatically cease work when the deadline has passed. Any
//!   requests sent by the server that use the request context will propagate the request deadline.
//!   For example, if a server is handling a request with a 10s deadline, does 2s of work, then
//!   sends a request to another server, that server will see an 8s deadline.
//! - Distributed tracing: tarpc is instrumented with
//!   [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) primitives extended with
//!   [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) traces. Using a compatible tracing subscriber like
//!   [Jaeger](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust/tree/main/opentelemetry-jaeger),
//!   each RPC can be traced through the client, server, and other dependencies downstream of the
//!   server. Even for applications not connected to a distributed tracing collector, the
//!   instrumentation can also be ingested by regular loggers like
//!   [env_logger](https://github.com/env-logger-rs/env_logger/).
//! - Serde serialization: enabling the `serde1` Cargo feature will make service requests and
//!   responses `Serialize + Deserialize`. It's entirely optional, though: in-memory transports can
//!   be used, as well, so the price of serialization doesn't have to be paid when it's not needed.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! Add to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:
//!
//! ```toml
//! tarpc = "0.27"
//! ```
//!
//! The `tarpc::service` attribute expands to a collection of items that form an rpc service.
//! These generated types make it easy and ergonomic to write servers with less boilerplate.
//! Simply implement the generated service trait, and you're off to the races!
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! This example uses [tokio](https://tokio.rs), so add the following dependencies to
//! your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! anyhow = "1.0"
//! futures = "0.3"
//! tarpc = { version = "0.27", features = ["tokio1"] }
//! tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["macros"] }
//! ```
//!
//! In the following example, we use an in-process channel for communication between
//! client and server. In real code, you will likely communicate over the network.
//! For a more real-world example, see [example-service](example-service).
//!
//! First, let's set up the dependencies and service definition.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # extern crate futures;
//!
//! use futures::{
//!     future::{self, Ready},
//!     prelude::*,
//! };
//! use tarpc::{
//!     client, context,
//!     server::{self, incoming::Incoming, Channel},
//! };
//!
//! // This is the service definition. It looks a lot like a trait definition.
//! // It defines one RPC, hello, which takes one arg, name, and returns a String.
//! #[tarpc::service]
//! trait World {
//!     /// Returns a greeting for name.
//!     async fn hello(name: String) -> String;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This service definition generates a trait called `World`. Next we need to
//! implement it for our Server struct.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # extern crate futures;
//! # use futures::{
//! #     future::{self, Ready},
//! #     prelude::*,
//! # };
//! # use tarpc::{
//! #     client, context,
//! #     server::{self, incoming::Incoming},
//! # };
//! # // This is the service definition. It looks a lot like a trait definition.
//! # // It defines one RPC, hello, which takes one arg, name, and returns a String.
//! # #[tarpc::service]
//! # trait World {
//! #     /// Returns a greeting for name.
//! #     async fn hello(name: String) -> String;
//! # }
//! // This is the type that implements the generated World trait. It is the business logic
//! // and is used to start the server.
//! #[derive(Clone)]
//! struct HelloServer;
//!
//! impl World for HelloServer {
//!     // Each defined rpc generates two items in the trait, a fn that serves the RPC, and
//!     // an associated type representing the future output by the fn.
//!
//!     type HelloFut = Ready<String>;
//!
//!     fn hello(self, _: context::Context, name: String) -> Self::HelloFut {
//!         future::ready(format!("Hello, {}!", name))
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Lastly let's write our `main` that will start the server. While this example uses an
//! [in-process channel](transport::channel), tarpc also ships a generic [`serde_transport`]
//! behind the `serde-transport` feature, with additional [TCP](serde_transport::tcp) functionality
//! available behind the `tcp` feature.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # extern crate futures;
//! # use futures::{
//! #     future::{self, Ready},
//! #     prelude::*,
//! # };
//! # use tarpc::{
//! #     client, context,
//! #     server::{self, Channel},
//! # };
//! # // This is the service definition. It looks a lot like a trait definition.
//! # // It defines one RPC, hello, which takes one arg, name, and returns a String.
//! # #[tarpc::service]
//! # trait World {
//! #     /// Returns a greeting for name.
//! #     async fn hello(name: String) -> String;
//! # }
//! # // This is the type that implements the generated World trait. It is the business logic
//! # // and is used to start the server.
//! # #[derive(Clone)]
//! # struct HelloServer;
//! # impl World for HelloServer {
//! #     // Each defined rpc generates two items in the trait, a fn that serves the RPC, and
//! #     // an associated type representing the future output by the fn.
//! #     type HelloFut = Ready<String>;
//! #     fn hello(self, _: context::Context, name: String) -> Self::HelloFut {
//! #         future::ready(format!("Hello, {}!", name))
//! #     }
//! # }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "tokio1"))]
//! # fn main() {}
//! # #[cfg(feature = "tokio1")]
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//!     let (client_transport, server_transport) = tarpc::transport::channel::unbounded();
//!
//!     let server = server::BaseChannel::with_defaults(server_transport);
//!     tokio::spawn(server.execute(HelloServer.serve()));
//!
//!     // WorldClient is generated by the #[tarpc::service] attribute. It has a constructor `new`
//!     // that takes a config and any Transport as input.
//!     let mut client = WorldClient::new(client::Config::default(), client_transport).spawn();
//!
//!     // The client has an RPC method for each RPC defined in the annotated trait. It takes the same
//!     // args as defined, with the addition of a Context, which is always the first arg. The Context
//!     // specifies a deadline and trace information which can be helpful in debugging requests.
//!     let hello = client.hello(context::current(), "Stim".to_string()).await?;
//!
//!     println!("{}", hello);
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!

//!
//! Use `cargo doc` as you normally would to see the documentation created for all
//! items expanded by a `service!` invocation.
