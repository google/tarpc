   |     ---------------------------------- ^^ the trait `Serialize` is not implemented for `FooRequest`
   |     |
   |     required by a bound introduced by this call
   |
   = help: the following other types implement trait `Serialize`:
             &'a T
             &'a mut T
             ()
             (T,)
             (T0, T1)
             (T0, T1, T2)
             (T0, T1, T2, T3)
             (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4)
           and $N others
