# Pre-push hook for the tarpc repository. To use this hook, copy it to .git/hooks in your repository
# root.
#
# This hook runs tests to make sure only working code is being pushed. If present, rustup is used
# to build and test the code on the appropriate toolchains. The working copy must not contain
# uncommitted changes, since the script currently just runs cargo build/test in the working copy.
#
# Options:
#
# - TARPC_ALLOW_DIRTY, default = 0
#
#   Setting this variable to 1 will run tests even though there are code changes in the working
#   copy. Set to 0 by default, since the intent is to test the code that's being pushed, not changes
#   still in the working copy.
#
# - TARPC_USE_CURRENT_TOOLCHAIN, default = 0
#
#   Setting this variable to 1 will just run cargo build and cargo test, rather than running
#   stable/beta/nightly.
#
# Note that these options are most useful for testing the hooks themselves. Use git push --no-verify
# to skip the pre-push hook altogether.
